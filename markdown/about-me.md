# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ now an incoming computer science master student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and a research assistant at Peking University. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

Research-wise, I'm currently mainly working on topics related to exploring the capability of machines to develop intelligent behavior upon what they have learned, like meta-learning and continual learning.

I used to work on natural language processing (machine translation and language generation), image captioning and image aesthetic assessment.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React, Electron and Golang.
